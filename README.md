# The book of d2l in tinygrad.

![anime waifu studying lol](./assets/anime_40.jpeg)

This are basically my notes on d2l. I wanted to use tinygrad to challenge
myself and learn a new framework. 

# Currently Implemented

- CNNs:
  - [X] LeNet
  - [X] AlexNet
  - [X] VGG
  - [X] NiN
  - [ ] GoogleLeNet
  - [X] ResNet
  - [ ] DenseNet

- RNNs:
  - [ ] LSTM
  - [ ] GRU 

- GANs:
  - [ ] tabular
  - [ ] DCGANS

I am using a conda environment and to activate it use:

```bash
conda activate d2l_tinygrad
```

I am using some dependencies, the following are what you should install: `matplotlib`, `tqdm`, `numpy`,`datasets` and of course `tinygrad`
